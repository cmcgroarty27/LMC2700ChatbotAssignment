Chatbot repository

To run you the stuff you go to the command window and then navigatete
to this repositiory. You then type:
npm init -y
node server.js
It won't work right now because the api key is invalid, and maybe the code needs some changing
but that's basically it. Don't touch the other files outside this one and openai-test.js.
